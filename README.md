# Lua0

Quick test of tiny-rlua in a zkvm. 

To run you must have `clang` installed and [the riscv32 toolchain](https://github.com/risc0/toolchain/releases/tag/2022.03.25) in your `$HOME` directory. Alternatively, if you have your own compatible toolchain, you can set the `LIBC_DIR` environment variable instad instead.
